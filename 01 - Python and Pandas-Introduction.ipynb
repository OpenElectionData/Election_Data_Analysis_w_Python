    "<b>What is Jupyter Notebook?</b>\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook, previously called \"iPython Notebook\" prior to version 4.0, is a way of interacting with Python code using a web browser. It is a very useful instructional tool that we will be using to introduce you to analysis with Python. Notebooks have the file extensions \"ipynb\" which are abbreviations of \"iPython Notebook\". Some websites such as nbviewer.ipython.org or www.github.com can view .ipynb files directly as rendered HTML. However, these are not interactive versions of the notebook, meaning, they are not running the python kernel which evaluates/interacts with the code. So the notebook is just a static version of the code contained inside of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to interact with notebook and start coding, you will need to launch Terminal (for Mac and Linux users). For Windows users, you will need to launch the Command Prompt Tool using the `cmd.exe` program.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Why Python?</b><br>\n",
    "Python is an easy-to-get-started language which handles data wrangling tasks in a simple and straightforward way. Python code is often said to be almost like pseudocode, since it allows you to express very powerful ideas in few lines of code while being very readable. It does not cost anything to install and use. Python also has a very open community that is quite supportive of new users. It also has many helpful packages that you can import and use that are well developed and documented. The Python language has the advantage of these Jupyter notebooks where you can easily use to add in comments and instructions. And it is easy to share the notebooks. The Python language is also very versatile and can be used to build applications. Python is a high-level, <a href=\"/files/images/matrix.gif\">dynamically typed multiparadigm</a> programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Pandas Data Analysis Library</b><br>\n",
    "Python and <a href=\"http://pandas.pydata.org/\">Pandas</a> can easily read in and handle very large datasets (like voters lists with millions of records) which are not possible in excel. The pandas package for python was built to use data structures that are tabular (which is a commonn structure for election datasets). Here is a <a href=\"https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/master/doc/cheatsheet/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf\"> Pandas Cheat Sheet </a> for common tasks. \n",

    "A Note on the 2.7 version of Python:<br>\n",
    "There are two major Python versions (or interpreters). Python 2.X and Python 3.X. The most recent stable version of Python 2.X is 2.7, which is the Python version used in this notebook. The newest recent version of Python 3.X is Python 3.4, which is also the newest Python version available but is not considered stable (as of Jan 2017) and not all of the packages will work in 3.4. For now, assume code you write for 2.7 will not work in 3.4. (The term used to describe this is to say that 3.4 breaks <i>backwards compatibility</i>.)\n"
